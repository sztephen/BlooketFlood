Python script to flood (spam bots) in blooket. 

This is a **VERY** slow way of doing this. It might take around a minute to initialize, then around 10 seconds per bot to join. This could be sped up with fast internet.


ðŸš¨ **HOW TO USE** ðŸš¨:
Download/copy the script ideally into Pycharm, but download the packages and once begin. 
1. It will ask for the Game ID, which is just the blooket one. 
2. Then the Base name, which is just the bot name you want it to be. 
3. Then Players, which is just the amount of players.
4. Finally, it will ask if you want "Headless", which is just window visibillity (just choose yes unless you want to debug, otherwise choose no)


ðŸ’¡ **IF ITS NOT WORKING:** ðŸ’¡ 
First WAIT but,
1. Turn headless off, it might be due to blooket detecting the bot spam, as you can check.
2. Check your internet connection
